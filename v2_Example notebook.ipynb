    "# Documentation for Hydra Multi-Asset Verification Test\n",

    "## Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology for the tests is to create two universes - one for Hydra and one for Uniswap - to subsequently be able to represent sequences of actions on each side. As the Hydra system is unique in its design and has no counterpart yet for approprate comparisons the role of the benchmark will be fulfilled by assembling several Uniswaps together in a way that everything that can be done in Hydra can be accordingly reproduced. This allows next to compare the implications on both systems and ultimately assess the quantitative and qualitative differences of results and impacts on the Hydra system and its agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach necessitates the definition and specification of two models:\n",
    "   - 1 Hydra Omnipool model with one instance that is defined in line with the [Hydra Mathematical Specification](https://hackmd.io/M7OeWimITKGVxBDHGQa6gQ?view)\n",
    "   - 1 Uniswap model with several instances that each are responsible for a particular mechanism\n",
    "        - which of 1 instance is used for liquidity provision in asset $R_i$: this is modeled as a Uniswap of $R_i$ and $Q$\n",
    "        - which of 1 instance is used for liquidity provision in asset $R_j$: this is modeled as a Uniswap of $R_j$ and $Q$\n",
    "        - which of 1 instance is used for swaps between assets $R_i$ and $R_j$: this is modeled as a Uniswap of $R_i$ and $R_j$\n",

    "        \n",
    "## Test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of testcases can be explored with this model resulting from a combination of the following parameters\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Event: Add Liquidity, Remove Liquidity, Swap Asset, Swap Asset for Base\n",
    "   - Asset: $R_i$, $R_j$, $R_k$, $Q$\n",
    "   - Multiple Action Type: Alternating, $i$ only, $j$ only\n",
    "   - Composite Action Type: Alternating, Trade Bias\n",
    "   - Enable Symmetric Liquidity: True, False\n",
    "    \n",
    "In addition to these settings also a fee structure can be imposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Fixed Fee\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The model specifies a number of eight agents that each have their local balances, can interact with the system and are modeled to be responsible for **one action only**. This allows to track for each testcase how the balances will develop and to show independently which events will trigger changes to local and global states. Most importantly directly and indirectly affected variables can be easily identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two dataframes of agents are initialized identically for both the Uniswap and the Hydra world and then work their way through on each side according to the testcase. Afterwards the effects on both sides can be compared.\n",

    "## Composite Action Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being able to test all mechanisms individually also compositions of actions can be performed. This means selecting and combining two from the above testcases and letting the respective agents take the actions repeadetly. A composition action test therefore is defined as two actions which each can be a combination of *event* and *asset* selected from the list of testcases above, for example:\n",
    "- Add liquidity in $R_i$ and Add liquidity in $R_j$\n",
    "- Add liquidity in $R_i$ and Swap $R_i$ for $Q$\n",
    "- Remove liquidity in $R_j$ and Swap $R_i$ for $Q$\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In total there would be 28 composit pairs which can be derived from this decision tree:\n",
    "selecting any one of the four primitive mechanisms of: **trade in/out** or **add/remove liquidity** of some given asset and then the subsequent action could be the three remaining mechanisms of the same asset or doing anyone of the four mechanisms in another asset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These basic combinations can be explored before further proceeding with\n",

    "## Introduction to Uniswap\n",
    ">Uniswap is an automated market maker for exchanging ERC20 tokens. Anyone can become a liquidity provider, and invest in the liquidity pool of an ERC20 token. This allows other users to trade that token for other tokens at an exchange rate based on their relative availibility. When a token trade is executed, a small fee is paid to the liquidity providers that enabled the transaction.\n",
    "https://uniswap.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically eight ways (_mechanisms_) in which an agent can interact with an instance of Uniswap (https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1/blob/master/contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy):\n",
    "1. `addLiquidity`: deposit ETH and tokens in the liquidity pool; mint UNI tokens - \"shares\" of that Uniswap instance - in exchange;\n",
    "1. `removeLiquidity`: burn UNI tokens; withdraw a proportional amount of ETH and tokens in exchange;\n",
    "1. `ethToTokenInput`: user specifies an exact amount of ETH they send; receives corresponding amount of tokens\n",
    "1. `ethToTokenOutput`: user sends some ETH and specifies an exact amount of tokens they want to buy; Uniswap refunds ETH sent in excess\n",
    "1. `tokenToEthInput`: user specifies an exact amount of tokens they send; receives corresponding amount of ETH\n",
    "1. `tokenToEthOutput`: user specifies an exact amount of ETH they want to buy; Uniswap takes the corresponding amount of tokens from the user account\n",
    "1. `tokenToTokenInput`: user specifies an exact amount of \"token A\" they send; receives corresponding amount of \"token B\" (effectively a `tokenToEthInput` in instance A combined with a `ethToTokenInput` in instance B)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Limitations and simplifications of this model\n",
    "* When triggering mechanisms, Uniswap users may include conditions they would like to apply to the transaction. For example, they could define a minimum amount of UNI tokens they wish to receive as a result of adding liquidity to the pool; or the maximum number of tokens they are willing to pay for the amount of ETH requested in a `tokenToEthOutput` operation; or a deadline after which the transaction should not be processed. **This simplified model does not account for this kind conditioning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `ethToTokenOutput`, `tokenToEthOutput` mechanisms are not implemented. **All swaps are treated as of the \"input defined\" type.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `tokenToToken` mechanism are not implemented, as they are merely a `tokenToEth` in the context of a single Uniswap instance.\n",
    "\n",
